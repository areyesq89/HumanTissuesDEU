The code is organized as an **R** package containing 6 different vignettes that reproduce 
different aspects of the manuscript. One contains the code to generated the pre-computed objects
from this package. Five of the vignettes contain the analyses related to each of the 5 figures of the manuscripts, 
respectively, and one of them contains the plots generated for the revision of the manuscripts. 
Since Github repositories have size limits, the **R** data objects of this package were deposited to
zenodo. In order to reproduce the results of the manuscript, you will have to build this package by 
follow the next steps:

1. Clone this repository:

2. Download **R** objects from zenodo:

3. Copy the downloaded objects to the corresponding data directories of the package

4. Build and install the package
